  }'
```

## üé≤ Built-in Game Templates

The system comes with flexible, configuration-driven game templates:

1. **Standard Card Game** - Basic card game with traditional 52-card deck (2-6 players)
2. **TAKI** - Fully configurable Israeli card game with custom deck and rules (2-10 players)
3. **Simple Number Cards** - Example of a custom deck with colored number cards (2-4 players)

All games are completely customizable through the configuration system - no hardcoded game logic!

## üîß Game Rule Structure

Game rules are defined using a flexible JSON structure that allows complete customization:

```json
{
  "name": "My Custom Card Game",
  "description": "A fully customizable card game",
  "min_players": 2,
  "max_players": 4,
  "deck_size": 20,
  "rules_data": {
    "initial_hand_size": 5,
    "win_condition": "first_to_empty_hand",
    "turn_actions": ["play_card", "draw_card", "custom_action"],
    "deck_configuration": {
      "description": "Custom deck description",
      "cards": [
        {
          "suit": "red",
          "rank": "1",
          "value": 1,
          "color": "red",
          "type": "number",
          "count": 2,
          "display_name": "Red One",
          "properties": {
            "special": false
          }
        }
      ],
      "transformations": [
        {
          "type": "duplicate_subset",
          "criteria": { "type": "action" },
          "times": 1
        }
      ]
    },
    "card_play_rules": {
      "play_rules": [
        { "type": "match_any_properties", "properties": ["color", "rank"] },
        { "type": "always_playable", "criteria": { "type": "wild" } }
      ],
      "special_effects": [
        {
          "criteria": { "rank": "skip" },
          "type": "skip_player",
          "message": "Next player is skipped!"
        }
      ]
    },
    "custom_actions": {
      "power_play": {
        "description": "Play multiple cards at once",
        "requirements": [
          { "type": "hand_size", "minimum": 3 }
        ],
        "state_changes": { "power_mode": true }
      }
    },
    "scoring": {
      "type": "points",
      "points": {
        "1": 1,
        "wild": 50,
        "default": 5
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Deck Configuration

The `deck_configuration` section allows you to define exactly what cards are in your deck:

#### Card Definition
- `suit`: The suit/category of the card
- `rank`: The rank/name of the card
- `value`: Numerical value for scoring
- `color`: Visual color of the card
- `type`: Type category (number, action, wild, special, etc.)
- `count`: How many of this card to include
- `display_name`: How the card appears to players
- `properties`: Custom properties for special rules

#### Deck Transformations
- `duplicate_subset`: Duplicate cards matching certain criteria
- `add_jokers`: Add joker cards to the deck
- `custom_mapping`: Apply custom transformations to cards

### Card Play Rules

The `card_play_rules` section defines how cards can be played:

#### Play Rule Types
- `match_property`: Card must match a specific property of the last played card
- `match_any_properties`: Card must match any of the specified properties
- `match_all_properties`: Card must match all specified properties
- `always_playable`: Cards matching criteria can always be played
- `conditional`: Complex conditional rules based on game state

#### Special Effects
Define what happens when certain cards are played:
- `skip_player`: Skip the next player's turn
- `reverse_direction`: Reverse the direction of play
- `force_draw`: Make players draw cards
- `custom_effect`: Apply custom game state changes

### Custom Actions

Define completely custom turn actions beyond the basic play/draw:

```json
"custom_actions": {
  "trade_cards": {
    "description": "Trade cards with another player",
    "requirements": [
      { "type": "has_card", "criteria": { "type": "trade" } }
    ],
    "state_changes": { "trading_phase": true }
  }
}
```

### Win Conditions
- `first_to_empty_hand`: First player to empty their hand wins
- `highest_score`: Player with highest score wins
- `lowest_score`: Player with lowest score wins
- `last_player_standing`: Last active player wins

### Turn Actions
You can define any custom turn actions. Common ones include:
- `play_card`: Play a card from hand
- `draw_card`: Draw a card from deck
- `pass`: Pass the turn
- `discard`: Discard a card
- Custom actions defined in `custom_actions`

### Scoring Systems
- `elimination`: First to empty hand wins (no scoring)
- `points`: Point-based scoring with custom point values
- `sets`: Score based on collecting sets of cards
- `custom`: Define your own scoring logic

### Card IDs and Gameplay

Each card in the deck gets a unique ID when the deck is generated. When players receive cards in their hand, they can reference specific cards by their ID rather than by position in hand. This makes gameplay more robust as hand order may change.

#### Playing Cards by ID
When making a `play_card` action, use the card's unique ID:

```json
{
  "action": "play_card",
  "card_id": 42
}
```

#### Card Structure
Each card in a player's hand includes:
```json
{
  "id": 42,
  "suit": "red",
  "rank": "5", 
  "value": 5,
  "color": "red",
  "type": "number",
  "display_name": "5 of red",
  "properties": {}
}
```

      "scoring": {
        "type": "elimination"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This creates a fully functional TAKI game where:
- Players can match cards by color or rank
- Wild cards can always be played
- Special effects trigger automatically (skip, force draw, etc.)
- Custom actions allow TAKI sequences and color changes
- The deck is exactly defined with the right card counts
